Aside from the intro scene, this cinematic has 3 different scenes, with different objects and backgrounds.

The first two scenes have audio assets, which are automatically played when starting the scenes. The first audio file is a remix of
a song I made in my free time and the second audio file came from a project in a previous class.

The first two scenes have image assets, which are shown immediately when starting the scenes. All of these image files were created
by me for various purposes.

The last two scenes have geometric shapes, a pink triangle in the 2nd scene and a white square in the last scene.

There is a logotype text in the 2nd scene, which I made for my YouTube channel.

There is a multi-line text in the last scene.

There is a fade transition between the 2nd and last scenes.

The image in the first scene is animated to slide out when transitioning to the next scene, and the last scene's text object slides in.
